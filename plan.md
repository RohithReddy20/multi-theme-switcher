# Multi-Theme Switcher App

## Objective of assignment:
Build a React-based web application with a theme switcher. The switcher should allow users to select from three distinct themes (Theme 1, Theme 2, Theme 3) using a dropdown in the header. Each theme should not only change colors, but also alter structure, fonts, spacing, and layout.

## Requirements:

### 1. Header
* Fixed top header with:
    * App name/logo (dummy)
    * Dropdown to switch between themes (Theme 1 as default)

### 2. Themes
Implement three complete themes with noticeable differences:
* **Theme 1 (Default):** Minimalist layout with light background, simple sans-serif font
* **Theme 2:** Dark mode with sidebar layout, bold serif font
* **Theme 3:** Colorful theme with card-based grid layout, playful Google Font (e.g., "Pacifico")

Layout, font size, margins, components' structure and overall look should be clearly different across themes.

### 3. Main Content
* Sample content area with:
    * Title
    * Dummy paragraph
    * Button
    * List or Card component
    * Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

### 4. Functionality
* Theme should persist across page reload (use `localStorage`)
* Use Context API or Redux for theme management
* Try using an API to call the data (https://fakestoreapi.com/products)
* Responsive design using CSS Modules, Tailwind, or Styled-components
* Avoid using large UI libraries like Material UI or Ant Design
* Add subtle animation while switching themes
* Use React Router and demonstrate the theme across multiple pages (Home, About, Contact)
* Use TypeScript
* Make sure app is secured
* Compatible with all devices
